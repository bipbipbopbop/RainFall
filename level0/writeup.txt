A binary named 'level0' is in the home folder.
A few tests show us that the program segfaults without arguments, and prints "No !" when we add one or more arguments.
A static analysis of the program shows us that their is a condition on wether the first argument is "423".
the command "./level0 423" create a bash prompt: the command `whoami` confirms us that we are the level1 user.


level0@RainFall:~$ ./level0 423
$ whoami
level1
$ cd ../level1
$ cat .pass
